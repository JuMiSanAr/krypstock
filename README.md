# krypstock

Krypstock is a tracker that allows investors to monitor their investments by creating and updating portfolios.

The user can choose whether they want to add stocks, cryptocurrencies or both to customize their portfolios.
The website also offers all sorts of real-time data, from candlestick charts to price changes or news.

This is useful for investors who want to try out different scenarios before putting their own money on the line, as well as those who use a particular or multiple exchanges and want to track their assets through a simple and precise third-party tracker.

The website is only supported for phone devices at the moment, but we are planning on bringing it to web browsers in the future.
A native app for iOS and Android is also in our plans.

Additionally, we are planning on connecting it to exchanges and DEXs so that the user can operate directly from Krypstock.
